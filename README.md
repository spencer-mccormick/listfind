# listfind

Listfind is a simple application created to test the comparative abilities of people to pick an item from a list of other items. It scores out of a maximum of 40 points per round, subtracting one point per 100 ms. Initialize with a list (newline-delimited) of items, probably English words, that you wish to compare. Several good text files of this nature exist on GitHub.
